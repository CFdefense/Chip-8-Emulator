# Chip-8
This project is a **Chip-8 interpreter and virtual machine** written in **Typescript** and running on **Node.js**. You may be asking **"What is Chip-8?"** Well... defined by Wikipedia, Chip-8 "is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker made on his 1802 Microprocessor." So to clarify Chip-8 is not an emulator, but an **interpreted programming language**. Nevertheless, We can use our interpreter to run basic **Chip-8 programs and video games!**

## Purpose
There are a lot of reasons that I wanted to work on a project like this. Not only can I gain hands-on experience with a larger project environment, but I can explore new programming languages, and understand hardware principles. Most importantly I get to collaborate with friends!

## Credits
This software draws inspiration and is an adaptation of works created by **Prof. Brian Gormanly and Prof. Alan Labouseur** at Marist College. Although their projects are designed for a 6502 architecture, they provided me with insight into how this project can be organized and developed. Furthermore, I also want to note my use of different resources including articles, GitHub repos, and Reddit posts, which have helped strengthen my understanding of Chip-8 and the different ways it can be implemented.
