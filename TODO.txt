IMPORTANT 
1. if youre having issues with pygame you need to pip install it (idk how on MAC so prob google)
however pygame is installed in .venv -> now that I look the .venv folder is not pushing to git so you will probably have to pip install on ur MAC
2. Test applications on your end such as test 1-3, BC test, both octojams, and test opcode
3. SPACE_INVADERS Does not seem to want to boot -> many issues could cause this because the program is not built out so dont worry about it so much rn

--TODO--
1. cpu test (test 4? is this an issue?)
2. Keyboard build and test (test 6) -> I am unsure how to log keypresses through pygame :?
3. Sound build and test (test 7)

Let me know what you are able to do so I can continue from there tmrw <3

ALSO Merge this branch and start a new one for ur changes cause cpu steps is done

---------------
merged branches.
created new branch
havent had time to test
built out some of keyboard and implemented keyboard functionality in System
check some of the comments in keyboard -- not sure about while true loop?

----------------
Continued on your work with the keyboard
I have successfully implemented cpu functions and the program recognizes the proper keys
HOWEVER there are some issues im sure you will immediately see when you run keytest
1. Overwhelming Delay 
2. Issues with keys being pressed simultaneously
3. 3rd test of keytest ie wait instruction needs fixing to include DT
I believe some of these may be errors due to me incorrectly setting up the keyboard methods
OR due to our cycle not being correct -> maybe why we see delay
4. ALSO Try to fix some error with flags test I fixed a few but there remains some which could interfer with our further tests
5. I also modified hz for testing you can change if needed




local web server with python -- python3 - m http.server -- should we do this? -> will need to abandon pygame if we do this
