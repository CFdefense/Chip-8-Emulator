By storing hexidecimal in bytearray we are converting the hexidecimal into ascii
IE we need to read 0xE0 as string becomes 69+48 etc -> not usable in future
I have went ahead and followed your lead by doing this, however, I believe
we should change the array type to string/some other and store hexidecimal
