By storing hexidecimal in bytearray we are converting the hexidecimal into ascii    -- its not ascii, its simply int/decimal
IE we need to read 0xE0 as string becomes 69+48 etc -> not usable in future -- this is incorrect. E0 is stored as 224 because hex to int conversion
I have went ahead and followed your lead by doing this, however, I believe
we should change the array type to string/some other and store hexidecimal



- We need to discuss more before we move on because we seem to not be on the same page
- Also there seems to be some confusion
- We need to discuss and study before moving on
- the byte array is storing the values as integers not ascii. Its simply doing a hex to integer conversion.
- If we need to output hex or do hex calculations simply take the int at an index and use .hex()

- Lets schedule a talk to go over this
